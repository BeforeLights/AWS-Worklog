| 5   | **Designed and deployed the FCJ Management application stack on AWS using EC2, RDS, and an Application Load Balancer.**<br>&emsp;+ Reviewed the **FCJ Management with Auto Scaling Group** workshop objectives and overall architecture to understand required AWS components and traffic flow.<br>&emsp;+ Built the **network infrastructure** by creating a dedicated **VPC**, public subnets, an **Internet Gateway**, and configuring route tables for internet access to the FCJ application.<br>&emsp;+ Launched a **FCJ EC2 application server** from an Amazon Linux/Ubuntu AMI, attached a security group with HTTP/SSH rules, and verified basic connectivity via public IP.<br>&emsp;+ Installed and configured **Node.js**, **npm**, and **PM2** on the EC2 instance, cloned the **FCJ Management** application source, and set it up as a managed PM2 process for resilience.<br>&emsp;+ Provisioned an **Amazon RDS** instance for the FCJ database, selected the required engine and instance class, configured networking/security groups, and enabled connectivity from the FCJ EC2 instance.<br>&emsp;+ Initialized the **FCJ database schema** and loaded sample data by running SQL scripts so that the application could perform end‑to‑end CRUD operations during testing.<br>&emsp;+ Verified full stack connectivity by starting the FCJ application on EC2, connecting to RDS, and confirming that core features worked over HTTP before introducing any load balancing or scaling. | 25/09/2025 | 26/09/2025 | [Deploying FCJ Management with Auto Scaling Group – AWS Study Group](https://000006.awsstudygroup.com/)<br><br>[Preparation - Deploying FCJ Management with Auto Scaling Group](https://000006.awsstudygroup.com/2-preparation/)<br><br>[Deploy Web Server](https://000006.awsstudygroup.com/2-preparation/2.5-deploy-web-server/)<br><br>[Launch a Database Instance with RDS](https://000006.awsstudygroup.com/2-preparation/2.3-launch-db-instance/)<br><br>[Setup data for Database](https://000006.awsstudygroup.com/2-preparation/2.4-add-data-to-db/) |
| 6   | **Implemented high availability and auto scaling for the FCJ Management application using Launch Templates, ALB, and multiple scaling strategies.**<br>&emsp;+ Created an **AMI** from the configured FCJ EC2 instance and built an **EC2 Launch Template** capturing AMI ID, instance type, networking, security groups, and user data for repeatable deployments.<br>&emsp;+ Configured an **Application Load Balancer** and **Target Group**, registered the FCJ instances as targets, and validated health checks and routing via the ALB DNS name.<br>&emsp;+ Set up an **EC2 Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** using the Launch Template, attached it to the Target Group, and confirmed that new instances joined the ALB and served traffic correctly.<br>&emsp;+ Implemented **manual scaling** by adjusting ASG desired capacity, observed new FCJ instances launching, and validated load distribution and health status through the ALB.<br>&emsp;+ Configured **scheduled scaling** actions to automatically increase capacity during a defined “peak” window and decrease it afterward, then tested that the schedule executed as expected.<br>&emsp;+ Implemented **dynamic (target‑tracking) scaling** based on metrics such as CPU utilization or request count, ran load tests through the ALB, and observed automatic scale‑out and scale‑in behavior.<br>&emsp;+ Prepared **custom CloudWatch metrics** for **predictive scaling**, created a predictive scaling policy on the ASG, and reviewed forecast vs. actual capacity graphs to understand how future scaling decisions are generated.<br>&emsp;+ Performed end‑to‑end testing of all scaling modes (manual, scheduled, dynamic, predictive), monitored instance lifecycle events and metrics, and documented cost considerations for EC2, RDS, and ALB resources. | 26/09/2025 | 26/09/2025      | [Create Launch Template](https://000006.awsstudygroup.com/3-create-launch-template/)<br><br>[Setting Up Load Balancer](https://000006.awsstudygroup.com/4-setup-load-balancer/)<br><br>[Create Auto Scaling Group](https://000006.awsstudygroup.com/6-create-auto-scaling-group/)<br><br>[Test - Deploying FCJ Management with Auto Scaling Group](https://000006.awsstudygroup.com/5-test/)<br><br>[Test solutions - Deploying FCJ Management with Auto Scaling Group](https://000006.awsstudygroup.com/7-test-solutions/)<br><br>[Read metrics of predictive scaling solution](https://000006.awsstudygroup.com/7-test-solutions/7.4-test-predictive-scaling-solution/) |


### Week 3 Achievements:
*   Successfully imported a local Ubuntu VM into AWS as an AMI using `vmimport` roles and AWS CLI.
*   Deployed the FCJ Management App with a secure VPC architecture (Public/Private Subnets).
*   Configured an Auto Scaling Group behind an ALB, proving the ability to scale out during demand spikes.
*   Verified database connectivity between the EC2 instances and the RDS database layer secure within private subnets.
