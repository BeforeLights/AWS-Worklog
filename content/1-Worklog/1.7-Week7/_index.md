### Week 7 Objectives:
*   Deploy and configure Amazon FSx for Windows File Server with AD integration.
*   Perform storage administration tasks: deduplication, quotas, and shadow copies.
*   Benchmark file system performance using DiskSpd and monitor via CloudWatch.
*   Reinforce cloud architecture knowledge through gamified learning (AWS Card Clash).

### Tasks to be carried out this week:
| Day | Task                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference Material                        |

| 5   |- Played **AWS Card Clash** matches with teammates to place the right **AWS service cards** into sample cloud architecture diagrams and see how services connect.<br>&emsp;- Talked through each round to explain in simple terms what the main services do (for example, which ones handle compute, storage, or networking) so everyone could remember them more easily.<br>&emsp;- Loaded **lecture notes and AWS study links** into **NotebookLM** and used it to highlight key ideas and generate short explanations for topics that still felt confusing.<br>&emsp;- Asked **NotebookLM** to create study questions and short summaries from those notes so the mid-term review felt more like a guided Q&A instead of just re-reading everything.<br>&emsp;- Used **Gemini** to turn mid-term topics into small practice quizzes and flashcards, then answered them to check which AWS areas still need more revision.<br>&emsp;- Re-checked any unclear answers using official AWS learning materials to be sure the explanations and quiz responses matched how the services actually work. | 23/10/2025 | 23/10/2025 |[AWS Card Clash: Learn Cloud Architecture](https://aws.amazon.com/awstv/watch/3c8b7eb882c/)<br><br>[Introducing AWS Card Clash mobile](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/training-and-certification/introducing-aws-card-clash-mobile-learn-aws-architecture-through-strateg/)|
| 6   | **Configured quotas, high-availability shares, capacity scaling, cleanup, and reviewed AWS CLI workflows for FSx for Windows.**<br>&emsp;+ Enabled **per-user storage quotas** on the FSx file system using the FSx remote PowerShell interface, set default limits and warnings, and enforced a custom quota for a specific user.<br>&emsp;+ Created a **continuously available, encrypted SMB share** for SQL workloads on FSx, using credentials from AWS Secrets Manager and the FSx PowerShell CLI to enable Continuous Availability.<br>&emsp;+ Scaled **throughput and storage capacity** of the FSx file system from the console, increasing MB/s and total GiB while allowing FSx to perform online optimization in the background.<br>&emsp;+ Deleted the **entire FSx lab environment** by removing the original CloudFormation stack and confirming that all associated resources were terminated to avoid ongoing costs.<br>&emsp;+ Read the **“Using the AWS CLI (reference)”** section to understand how to automate FSx, AD, and related tasks with AWS CLI instead of the console.| 24/10/2025 | 24/10/2025 | [Managing storage quotas - Amazon FSx for Windows File Server](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/managing-user-quotas.html)<br><br>[Managing throughput and storage capacity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/managing-throughput-capacity.html)<br><br>[One-time file system setup tasks using the Amazon FSx CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/WindowsGuide/one-time-admin-tasks.html)|
