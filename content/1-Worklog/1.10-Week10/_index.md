### Week 10 Objectives:

### Tasks to be carried out this week:
| Day | Task                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference Material                        |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 2   |**Extended and hardened the Step Functions workflow with activation, pause/resume via callbacks, robust error handling, and parallelized checks.**<br>&emsp;+ Updated the **SubmitApplication Lambda** to start state machine executions automatically with the right payload, turning manual tests into an event-driven workflow entry point.<br>&emsp;+ Implemented a **callback-based Pending Review step** using task tokens so flagged applications pause in Step Functions until a separate review Lambda resumes them with an approve/reject decision.<br>&emsp;+ Added **Retry** and **Catch** blocks to critical Task states so transient Lambda/API failures are retried with backoff while unrecoverable errors flow into explicit error-handling paths.<br>&emsp;+ Converted sequential checks into a **Parallel state** so name and address validations run concurrently, then adjusted the Choice logic to interpret the combined parallel output correctly.<br>&emsp;+ Wrapped up by exploring **advanced Step Functions resources** (long-running workflows, Map/Wait states, and official samples) to plan next steps for production-ready orchestration patterns. | 10/11/2025 | 10/11/2025      |[StartExecution – AWS Step Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/apireference/API_StartExecution.html)<br><br>[Callback patterns with task tokens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/callback-task-sample-sqs.html)<br><br>[Handling errors in Step Functions workflows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-error-handling.html)<br><br>[Parallel workflow state](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/state-parallel.html)<br><br>[Tutorials and workshops for learning Step Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/learning-resources.html)|
| 3   |**Built the foundational SNS alert dispatch system: Email/EmailJSON for inbox delivery, custom Lambda code for Telegram with bot setup and topic-based group chat, and generated GuardDuty test findings.**<br>&emsp;+ Created an **SNS topic** (`SNSToTelegram`) and subscribed **Email and EmailJSON** directly so security alerts automatically route to your email inbox without any Lambda processing.<br>&emsp;+ Set up a **Telegram bot** via BotFather, retrieved the bot token, created a group chat, enabled **Topics** feature, and extracted the **chat ID and message thread ID** for targeted alert routing.<br>&emsp;+ Deployed a **Telegram Lambda function** with the bot token, chat ID, and message thread ID stored as **environment variables**, then coded the function to parse SNS messages and forward them to the Telegram topic.<br>&emsp;+ Configured the **SNS topic to trigger the Telegram Lambda** so incoming security events automatically send notifications to both your email and the Telegram group chat topic simultaneously.<br>&emsp;+ Generated **AWS GuardDuty sample findings** (more than 1000 emails... This was a mistake).| 11/11/2025 | 11/11/2025 ||
| 4   |**Structured the AWS Incident Response System project in Jira by defining core epics, assigning ownership across multiple teams, and establishing the foundation for incident handling workflows.**<br>&emsp;+ Created **5 key epics** in Jira to map the incident response workflow: Threat Detection, Alerting, Response Workflow, Data Pipeline, and Dashboard components.<br>&emsp;+ Assigned **epic ownership to individual team members** so each area has a clear lead responsible for its scope and delivery.<br>&emsp;+ Organized **team structure and responsibilities** by aligning each epic with the appropriate skill set (threat detection, alerting infrastructure, workflow orchestration, data ingestion, dashboarding).<br>&emsp;+ Configured **epic-to-task rolldown** in Jira so that sub-tasks and issues are tied to their parent epics, enabling team visibility and burndown tracking across the incident response system.| 12/11/2025 | 12/11/2025 ||
| 5   |**Optimized the alert system by replacing SNS Email subscription with Lambda→SES to reduce costs, enable custom email formatting, and leverage SES's higher sending limits.**<br>&emsp;+ Analyzed **SNS pricing impact** from GuardDuty sample findings and identified that direct Email subscriptions were generating unexpected charges on SNS delivery costs.<br>&emsp;+ Researched **AWS SES capabilities** and discovered it offers higher sending limits and full control over email formatting compared to SNS Email subscriptions.<br>&emsp;+ Created a **new Lambda function** to replace the SNS Email subscription that receives SNS messages, parses GuardDuty findings, and sends formatted HTML emails via **SES**.<br>&emsp;+ Implemented **custom email templates** in the SES Lambda with styled HTML, embedded alert metadata, severity indicators, and GuardDuty finding details for better readability and actionability.<br>&emsp;+ Updated the **SNS topic configuration** to trigger both the Telegram Lambda and the new SES Lambda, eliminating the Email subscription and reducing SNS charges while maintaining dual-channel (Email + Telegram) alert delivery.| 13/11/2025 | 13/11/2025 ||
