| 2   |**Started learning Three.js fundamentals using the Three.js Journey course to prepare for building interactive 3D web experiences.**<br>&emsp;+ Reviewed the **Three.js Journey introduction** to understand how **WebGL** works under the hood and how **Three.js** simplifies 3D rendering in the browser.<br>&emsp;+ Set up a minimal **Three.js project** with an HTML canvas, imported the library, and initialized a basic **scene, camera, and WebGL renderer** to display content on the page.<br>&emsp;+ Created a simple **3D cube mesh** using BoxGeometry and a basic material, then rendered it on screen to verify that the environment was configured correctly.<br>&emsp;+ Experimented with **camera position and object rotation** in the animation loop to see how changes affect the view and interaction feel in real time.<br>&emsp;+ Took notes on how these core Three.js concepts could later integrate with existing **JavaScript and frontend skills** for portfolio-style projects. | 27/10/2025 | 27/10/2025      | [Three.js Journey — Learn WebGL with Three.js](https://threejs-journey.com)<br><br>[three.js manual – Getting started](https://threejs.org/manual/)|
