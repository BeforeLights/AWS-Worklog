| 2   | - Completed **Quản trị dữ liệu và an toàn thông tin** MOOC in Coursera **(KS57 Program)** | 03/11/2025 | 03/11/2025 ||
| 3   | **Used AWS Glue and Amazon Athena to explore AWS Cost & Usage Reports and understand where cloud spending comes from.**<br>&emsp;+ Ran **simple Athena queries** on the Glue-created CUR tables to view example rows, check billing periods, and get familiar with the structure of the cost data.<br>&emsp;+ Summarized **costs by account and service** in Athena to see which accounts and AWS services are responsible for the highest spend, then focused on key **Amazon EC2 on-demand usage** lines for more detail.<br>&emsp;+ Checked **cost allocation tags** (such as a cost-center tag) in the CUR data to compare how much spend is correctly tagged to teams versus how much is still untagged.<br>&emsp;+ Compared **discounted usage (Savings Plans/Reserved Instances)** with estimated on-demand prices in Athena queries to see how much savings the discounts provide for specific EC2 usage types.<br>&emsp;+ Used the query results to build a clearer picture of **who is spending, on which services, and how efficiently**, as preparation for future cost optimization work. | 04/11/2025 | 04/11/2025      | [Cost and performance analysis with AWS Glue and Amazon Athena](https://000040.awsstudygroup.com/)<br><br>[Querying Cost and Usage Reports using Amazon Athena](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/cur-query-athena.html)<br><br>[AWS Cost and Usage Reports overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cur/latest/userguide/what-is-cur.html)<br><br>[Creating tables for CUR data using AWS Glue and Athena](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/creating-tables.html)<br><br>[Organizing and tracking costs with AWS cost allocation tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/cost-alloc-tags.html)<br><br>[Amazon Athena pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/pricing/) |
| 4   |**Set up Grafana to monitor my EC2 instance using CloudWatch and built a simple live dashboard.**<br>&emsp;+ Connected **Grafana** to **Amazon CloudWatch** as a data source so it can read EC2 metrics from my AWS account.<br>&emsp;+ Tested the data source and confirmed Grafana could successfully query CloudWatch metrics for my instance.<br>&emsp;+ Created a **Grafana dashboard** with panels showing key **EC2 metrics** like CPU usage over time.<br>&emsp;+ Saved the dashboard and used the **refresh and share** options so it can be reused to watch instance health in real time.| 05/11/2025 | 05/11/2025 |[Getting started with Grafana basic](https://000029.awsstudygroup.com/)<br><br>[Using Amazon CloudWatch metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/working_with_metrics.html)<br><br>[Grafana CloudWatch data source configuration](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/aws-cloudwatch/)<br><br>[Build your first Grafana dashboard](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/fundamentals/getting-started/first-dashboards/)| 
| 5   |**Completed the end-to-end **CDK-based setup** for an EC2 web server environment used in the **AWS Storage Gateway** lab, using local **VS Code** instead of Cloud9.**<br>&emsp;+ Finished the **introduction** and **preparation** steps, including creating the required **IAM role** that lets Storage Gateway access **S3** securely. <br>&emsp;+ Set up a local **AWS CDK** development environment in **VS Code** with the AWS CLI configured for the correct account and region. <br>&emsp;+ **Initialized** a new **AWS CDK** project, defined a **VPC** with public subnets, and checked the synthesized CloudFormation template for errors from the local machine. <br>&emsp;+ **Updated** the CDK stack to add an **EC2 instance**, security group, and user data script that installs **Apache**, then deployed the stack and validated the web server from the instance’s public IP.| 06/11/2025 | 06/11/2025 |[CDK Basic](https://000038.awsstudygroup.com)|
| 6   |**Completed the core AWS Step Functions workshop: modeled the business flow, wired sample services, and deployed a SAM-managed state machine with proper IAM permissions.**<br>&emsp;+ Reviewed the **business domain and workflow details** for the account application process, identifying each business step to later map into Step Functions states.<br>&emsp;+ Set up a **local VS Code + AWS Toolkit environment** and used it (instead of Cloud9 since I can't use it) to work with the workshop’s sample backend services and infrastructure in the target AWS region.<br>&emsp;+ Built the first **AWS Step Functions state machine** to orchestrate account creation and data checks, then used the execution graph/history to verify each Task state’s input and output.<br>&emsp;+ Refined **Task states and state input/output handling** with `InputPath` and `ResultPath` so application data and check results are preserved cleanly through the workflow.<br>&emsp;+ Migrated the state machine into a **SAM template** with a dedicated execution role, letting CloudFormation manage deployments and IAM for the workflow end-to-end.| 07/11/2025 | 07/11/2025 | [Get Started with AWS Step Functions](https://000047.awsstudygroup.com/)<br><br>[Using AWS SAM to build Step Functions workflows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-sam-sfn.html)<br><br>[Working with AWS CDK and Toolkit in VS Code](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/toolkit-for-vscode/latest/userguide/aws-cdk-apps.html)<br><br>[Processing input and output in Step Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-input-output-filtering.html)<br><br>[Service-level permissions for Step Functions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concept-create-iam-advanced.html) |
