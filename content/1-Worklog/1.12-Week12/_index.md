### Week 12 Objectives:

### Tasks to be carried out this week:
| Day | Task                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference Material                        |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 2   |**Designed the S3 dashboard with Kiệt to define key metrics and UX improvements, then fixed bugs and optimized dashboard performance.**<br>&emsp;+ Brainstormed **S3 dashboard layout** with Kiệt, alert summary cards, timeline, severity distribution, and real-time metrics for alert volume and delivery success.<br>&emsp;+ Identified **UX issues**: missing filters, unclear alert grouping, and missing detail.<br>&emsp;+ Fixed **bugs**: Query errors and UI bugs<br>&emsp;+ Optimized **dashboard queries** for faster aggregation, added real-time refresh, and improved visual hierarchy so critical findings stand out, tested with GuardDuty events.| 24/11/2025 | 24/11/2025 ||
| 3   |**Identified a critical security and cost issue: unauthenticated dashboard access causing unlimited Athena queries on page refresh, then explored authentication solutions.**<br>&emsp;+ Discovered the **S3 dashboard had no login page**, so anyone could refresh and trigger expensive Athena queries without authorization.<br>&emsp;+ Attempted **Cognito + Lambda@Edge** integration to add authentication at the edge, but hit a blocker: my CloudFront distribution used **flat pricing** (not pay-as-you-go) and **couldn't be switched**, making Lambda@Edge unusable.<br>&emsp;+ Tried **CloudFront Functions** as an alternative, combining it with **Lambda** to implement request filtering and basic auth without Lambda@Edge.| 25/11/2025 | 25/11/2025 ||
| 4   |**Debugged CloudFront/Lambda session issues, evaluated AWS Amplify but pivoted to React-based authentication to meet the deadline.**<br>&emsp;+ Spent hours troubleshooting **CloudFront Functions + Lambda** setup, the following could be the reasons: sessions weren't persisting and cross-domain access from S3 was blocked, no viable solution found.<br>&emsp;+ Explored **AWS Amplify** as an alternative for managed authentication, but realized the current dashboard structure wasn't compatible without significant refactoring and time wasted.<br>&emsp;+ Decided to **implement authentication directly in the React dashboard** given the tight deadline.<br>&emsp;+ Integrated **Cognito login** directly into React components with token-based session management, protecting dashboard access and Athena query execution.<br>&emsp;+ Tested the **React auth flow** end-to-end—users now must authenticate before viewing the dashboard, and only authorized sessions can trigger Athena queries, solving both security and cost issues.| 26/11/2025 | 26/11/2025 ||
| 5   |This is a side project: **Installed Arch Linux on a friend's prebuilt PC and began WireGuard VPN setup, learning pacman package management along the way.**<br>&emsp;+ Installed **Arch Linux** on a prebuilt system as an alternative to the default OS—now I can legitimately say "I use Arch btw".<br>&emsp;+ Researched **network security** for the PC and identified **WireGuard** as a lightweight, modern VPN solution to secure group traffic.<br>&emsp;+ Discovered **pacman** (Arch's package manager) works differently from **apt**—spent time hunting for WireGuard packages and understanding Arch's repository structure (core, extra, community).<br>&emsp;+ Began configuring **WireGuard** on the Arch system but realized the setup complexity required more time than available in one day.<br>&emsp;+ Documented all package names and configuration steps for continuation the next day.| 27/11/2025 | 27/11/2025 ||
| 6   |**Completed WireGuard VPN installation and configuration on Arch Linux, resolving pacman dependency issues and testing peer connectivity.**<br>&emsp;+ Finished **WireGuard installation** using pacman, resolving dependency conflicts and finding correct package versions for Arch.<br>&emsp;+ Generated **WireGuard keys** (public/private) and configured peer connections for the group's high school project network.<br>&emsp;+ Set up **network interfaces** and IP routing on Arch with proper firewall rules to enable secure VPN access between group members.<br>&emsp;+ Tested **WireGuard connectivity** end-to-end—verified peers could connect and communicate through the encrypted tunnel reliably.<br>&emsp;+ Documented the complete setup process for the group so others could replicate the WireGuard configuration on their systems.| 28/11/2025 | 28/11/2025 ||
