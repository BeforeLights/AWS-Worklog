| 2   |**Completed end-to-end setup of a hybrid DNS environment using Route 53 Resolver with AWS Managed Microsoft AD and RD Gateway.**<br>&emsp;+ Launched the provided **CloudFormation** template to create a custom **VPC**, public/private subnets across two **Availability Zones**, **Internet Gateway**, and **NAT Gateways** for outbound access from private subnets.<br>&emsp;+ Configured a **Remote Desktop Gateway (RDGW) EC2 instance** in the public subnet, adjusted **security groups** for controlled **RDP/ICMP** access, and verified remote connectivity from the local workstation.<br>&emsp;+ Deployed **AWS Managed Microsoft AD**, joined RDGW to the managed domain, and confirmed domain authentication from the RD session host. <br>&emsp;+ Created **Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoints** in private subnets and forwarding rules so VPC workloads can resolve on-premises-style domain names via the managed AD DNS servers. <br>&emsp;+ Created **Route 53 Resolver inbound endpoints** and rules to allow external or on-premises DNS forwarders to resolve private AWS hostnames in the VPC, completing the hybrid DNS flow. <br>&emsp;+ Tested DNS name resolution from the RDGW instance to ensure queries for both **AWS private records and on-premises-style domains** were correctly routed through the configured Resolver endpoints and AD DNS. | 06/10/2025 | 06/10/2025      | [AWS Managed Microsoft AD - AWS Directory Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/directory_microsoft_ad.html)<br><br>[What is Route 53 VPC Resolver?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver.html)<br><br>[NAT Gateways - Amazon VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) |
| 3   | **Completed end-to-end AWS CLI practice across core services (S3, SNS, IAM, VPC, EC2) using an SSO-authenticated profile.**<br>&emsp;+ Used **AWS CLI with Amazon S3** to create and inspect S3 buckets and objects instead of doing those actions in the console.<br>&emsp;+ Practiced **AWS CLI with Amazon SNS** by creating topics, adding email subscriptions, and sending test notifications.<br>&emsp;+ Managed **IAM identities via AWS CLI**, creating users/groups and handling access keys through the command line.<br>&emsp;+ Built networking with **VPC and Internet Gateway using AWS CLI**, creating a custom VPC, subnets, and public routing for internet access.<br>&emsp;+ Launched and managed an **EC2 instance via AWS CLI**, tested SSH connectivity, and terminated the instance after the lab.<br>&emsp;+ Ran all labs using **`aws login`** instead of static access keys from `aws configure`. | 07/10/2025 | 07/10/2025 | [Getting Started with the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html)<br><br>[Getting started with Amazon S3 using the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/GettingStartedS3CLI.html)<br><br>[Accessing Amazon SNS in the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-services-sns.html)<br><br>[IAM examples using AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli_iam_code_examples.html)<br><br>[Getting started with Amazon VPC using the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/getting-started-with-amazon-vpc-using-the-aws-cli.html)<br><br>[Using Amazon EC2 in the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-services-ec2.html)<br><br>[Configuring IAM Identity Center authentication with the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html) |
