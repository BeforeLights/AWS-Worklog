### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always willing to help whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me focus better. We also have frequent social gatherings and team bonding activities which help strengthen our relationships and make the atmosphere even more enjoyable.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don’t understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. They also diligently share links to free Udemy courses and other high-quality learning resources to help us improve. The admin team supports administrative tasks, provides necessary documents, and creates favorable conditions for me to work effectively. I especially appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving the answer.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
While the specific tasks—focused on software engineering, web, and app development—do not directly align with my university's current curriculum, I find this to be a significant advantage. It has pushed me to venture into new areas I hadn't encountered before, allowing me to build valuable new skills effectively.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
During the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. Most importantly, I gained deep hands-on experience with AWS services and cloud architecture. The mentor also shared valuable real-world experiences that helped me better plan my career path.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive, welcoming, and supportive. Everyone respects each other, works seriously but still keeps things enjoyable. For projects, each team works cohesively, and when there are urgent matters, everyone supports one another regardless of their position. This made me feel like a real part of the team, even as an intern.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The company offers highly flexible working hours which is very convenient. The true value lies in the immense knowledge gained regarding cloud technologies and the professional connections established during the internship, which are invaluable for my future career.

### Additional Questions
- What did you find **most satisfying** during your internship?  
  The most satisfying aspect was successfully setting up complex integrations like Telegram and Cognito. Seeing the authentication flow work seamlessly and being able to deploy the entire infrastructure using AWS CDK gave me a strong sense of accomplishment in mastering these technical challenges.

- What do you think the company **should improve** for future interns?  
  I believe the timeline of the workshops could be improved. Specifically, scheduling the Mastery Series earlier, before the project phase begins, would provide interns with the necessary foundational knowledge to tackle the project more effectively from the start.

- If recommending to a friend, would you **suggest they intern here**? Why or why not?  
  Yes, I would definitely recommend it. The community is incredibly welcoming, and the mentors are genuinely supportive. I particularly appreciate the culture of mutual support and the shared mindset of continuous self-improvement and helping one another grow.
