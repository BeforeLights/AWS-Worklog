During my internship at **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** from **08/09/2025** to **12/12/2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.  
I participated in the **AWS First Cloud Journey Internship**, through which I improved my skills in **Cloud Computing, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), DevOps practices, Security compliance, and Solutions Architecture**.  

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency.

### Sharing and Feedback

My internship at Amazon has been a transformative experience, marking my transition from a student to a cloud professional. The journey began with foundational knowledge of core AWS services like EC2, VPC, and IAM, but quickly escalated to complex, real-world scenarios involving Serverless architectures, Event-Driven designs, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

One of the most valuable aspects was the shift in mindset, from simply "making things work" with ClickOps to ensuring they are scalable, reproducible, and secure using tools like CloudFormation and adopting the AWS Well-Architected Framework. Participating in events like the "AWS Cloud Mastery Series" expanded my horizon beyond technical skills, introducing me to the importance of security pillars, cost optimization, and the power of Generative AI.

While there were challenges, such as the steep learning curve of new services like Step Functions and the discipline required for continuous self-learning, the support from the community and mentors was invaluable. This internship has not only equipped me with technical proficiency but also instilled a culture of customer obsession and ownership that I will carry forward in my career.

### Needs Improvement

*   **Strengthen Discipline and Compliance:** Strictly adhere to organizational schedules, rules, and processes to ensure professionalism and reliability (addressing the "Average" rating).
*   **Enhance Proactiveness and Responsibility:** Take more initiative in seeking out tasks and responsibilities rather than waiting for instructions, improving from "Fair" to "Good".
*   **Improve Team Contribution:** Contribute more actively to team discussions and brainstorm innovative ideas to increase my overall impact on the project.
*   **Deepen Professional Knowledge:** Accelerate the learning curve for new technologies to apply them more proficiently in practical scenarios.
